# Test cases for the Inventory of Devices API

| ID | Title | Request | Endpoint |
|:--:|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
| TC_INV_01 |Verify retrieving currently saved devices| GET | /inventory/devices|

**Pre-conditions:**
 - The API server is running.
 -  All tests should be run only against HTTPS (port `8443`) or HTTP (port `8080`) for each session.
 - No prior PUT requests should have been made to the `/inventory/devices` endpoint during the session.

**Test Steps:**
1. Send a GET request to  `/inventory/devices`.

**Expected Results:**
1. Response status code should be `200 OK`. 
2. Response body should be an array of devices predefined in the `inventory_devices.json` file. 
3. For each device in the array Ðµnsure the presence of the following keys:
	 -  `build`
	 -  `deviceAddresses` (with sub-keys: `fqdn`, `ipv4Address`, `ipv6Address`)
	 -  `id`
	 -  `ipAddress`
	 -  `model`
	 -  `serialNum`
	 -  `version`
4. Validate that the values of these keys match the expected format and structure.

| TC_INV_02 |Verify changing the response body and status code of GET request| PUT| /inventory/devices|

**Pre-conditions:**
- The API server is running.
- All tests should be run only against HTTPS (port `8443`) or HTTP (port `8080`) for each session.

**Test Steps:**
1. Send a **PUT** request to `/inventory/devices` with the following request body and modifications:
- Test Case 1: Complete data.
```json
{
	"body": [
		{
			"build": "20240410.1854-8f4e21frg65t",
			"deviceAddresses": {
			"fqdn": "test.com",
			"ipv4Address": "10.0.49.140",
			"ipv6Address": null
			},
			"id": "UPDATED_1",
			"ipAddress": "10.0.49.140",
			"model": "TEST_DEVICE",
			"serialNum": "TEST1-1fecaf6a-0619-41b1-86d8-acf36064f9ec",
			"version": "2.3.12"
		}
	],
	"status_code": 201
}
```

- Test Case 2: Remove a key in the device object from the request body (remove `build` key).
 - Test Case 3: Change the value for a key to a different type (change `id` from string to integer).
 - Test Case 4: Send an empty list in the body (`[]`).
 - Test Case 5: Send an object (rather than a list) in the body (`{}`).
 - Test Case 6: Change the status code to a string (`"201"` instead of `201`, parse it to integer in automation).

**Expected Results:**
 1. Response status code of the **PUT** request should be `200 OK`.
 2. Response body should be an object containing the following keys:
	-  `new_body`
	-  `new_status_code`
3. The value of `new_body` in the response should match the `body` sent in the **PUT** request.
4. The value of `new_status_code` in the response should match the `status_code` sent in the **PUT** request.
5. Send a **GET** request to `/inventory/devices` and verify that:
6. The response body equals the `new_body` sent in the **PUT** request.
7. The response status code equals `new_status_code` sent in the **PUT** request.
